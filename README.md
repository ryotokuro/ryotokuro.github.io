# Portfolio Website (ryotokuro.github.io)
This is a repository for the code used to design and actualise my portfolio website.
My portfolio is hosted on GitHub (as you can probably see).

The languages that I will probably be looking to use are:
* HTML
* CSS
* Java (JS, ReactJS, NodeJS)

I would also like to perhaps experiment a bit with other frameworks like Flask, etc.

You can also visit the redirect using http://ryotokuro.co/ to watch me slowly figure things out :)
Website link will expire soon want to update this :(
