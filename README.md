# ryotokuro.github.io# portfolio
This is a repository for the code used to design and actualise my portfolio website.
My portfolio is hosted on GitHub (as you can probably see).

The languages that I will probably be looking to use are:
* HTML
* CSS
* Java (JS, ReactJS, NodeJS)

You can also visit the redirect using http://ryotokuro.co/ once I figure things out :)
